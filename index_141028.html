                        <strong>300% Welcome Bonus</strong>
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The Welcome Bonus is a first time sign up bonus that is applied to a member's first deposit only. The Welcome Bonus cannot be combined with any other bonus or promotion.</li>
                        <li>To qualify to receive the Welcome Bonus, you must: (a) register as a member of this website (which means that you accept the website Terms and Conditions, which can be found at <a href="http://www.sunbingo.co.uk/terms">www.sunbingo.co.uk/terms</a>); (b) accept the Welcome Bonus when you make your first deposit; (c) make a minimum deposit of £10.</li>
                        <li>The Welcome Bonus you receive will be 300% of your first deposit, up to a maximum deposit of £100. By way of example: (a) if you deposit £10, you will receive a Welcome Bonus of £30, which means that you will have £40 to play; and (b) if you deposit £100, you will receive a Welcome Bonus of £300, which means that you will have £400 to play. The maximum Welcome Bonus you can receive is £300.</li>
                        <li>The Welcome Bonus will be credited to your account automatically after you have made the first deposit. It may take up to 72 working hours for the bonus to be credited.</li>
                        <li>Following the issue of the Welcome Bonus into your member account, the initial amount you wager will be deducted from your bonus amount first. The bonus is comprised of both the Welcome Bonus received and any deposit amount tied to that Welcome Bonus. In the event of a win, your Welcome Bonus balance will be topped up with all win amounts. You will not be able to withdraw any winnings won when wagering with bonus money until you have met the wagering requirements of your Welcome Bonus.</li>
                        <li>Once wagering requirements on your Welcome Bonus have been met, you may withdraw any winnings or cash in your member account. Members are required to wager 2 times the Welcome Bonus received before making a withdrawal. Some games contribute different amounts towards such wagering requirements. In total, members are required to wager</li>

                        <ul class="sub">
                            <li>2 times the amount of the Welcome Bonus on bingo games (90, 80, 75, Bargain); or</li>
                            <li>40 times the amount of the Welcome Bonus on slot games and instant win games</li>
                            <li>160 times the amount of the Welcome Bonus on Roulette Splendide</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Snap and Blackjack does not contribute to any wagering requirements.</p>
                        <p>Example: If you receive a Welcome Bonus of £10, you will need to wager £20 to meet your wagering requirements. The table below outlines how much will be deducted from your wagering requirements based on a £10 bet and how much you need to wager in total to meet the play through requirements, based on £10 Welcome Bonus.</p>
